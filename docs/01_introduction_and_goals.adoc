== Introduction and Goals
The goal of the project is to develop a software system that allows users to create personalized maps holding any place they want. These maps will be completely controlled by the users and may include places such as shops, bars, sights, etc. The software will include features to allow the users to add reviews, comments, etc.; share information with others; and many other options.

=== Requirements Overview
The principal motivation for the creation of this system is to develop a software that the users could use to move around their cities, save interesting places for them, find or promote different places of it, etc.

The software is planned to include several features to provide several services. It must:

* Allow the users to add and store any location they want to include in their maps.
* Customize said locations with images and names.
* Allow to add and see their and other person's reviews, comments, pics, etc. about some place.
* Include a way of managing the information that is accessible with other users, i.e. the level of privacy desired for each piece of information.
* Filter the map's markers by category, friends, etc.

These and more requirements can be found in the link:https://arquisoft.github.io/course2223/labAssignmentDescription.html[version 1.0 of the assignment description].

|QS4|Operability|Performance|25 concurrent users request the map of a given city in less than 10 seconds.
|QS7|Integrity|Privacy|Sensible user data will not be accessible for anyone but the user.
|QS8|Maintainability & Support|Testability|The application should have a test coverage greater than 80%.
