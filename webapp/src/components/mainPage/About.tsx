        <p>
          We are a group of students from the University of Oviedo (UniOvi), from the Software Engineering degree.
          This app has been developed for the Subject Architecture subject, whose goal is to help us practice working
          on big projects in teams composed by many people.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Our team is made up from six programming beginners who are passionated about learning everything they can 
          about all the things related to software and computering, and this app is the result of all the hard work 
          and time we have spent over two months.
